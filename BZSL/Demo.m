% Bayesian Zero Shot Learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   DEMO    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This fuction demostrates the usage of BZSL on the datasets in (Generalized)
% Zero-shot learning domain: CUB, aPY, SUN, AWA & FLO
% The flow of the Demo is as follows,
% 1.    Load the one of the abovementioned data, they have specific train and
% test split nad attached attributes for each class. We have utilized the
% train, test and validation split provided in the datasets itself.
%
% 2.    Partitioning the training data into training and test data for the
% purpose of hyperparamter tuning. tuning_split.m script splits the training
% data into training and test (2 seperate sets: seen and unseen classes).  
% All these datasets have their ZSL specified partitioning and we followed  
% the exact same splitting fashion as in the literature.
%
% 3.    Hyperparameter tuning for the parameters of the BZSL. The matlab
% scritp hyperparameter_tuning.m implements this tuning. The must inputs
% for the tuning is the data split from tuning_split, attriburtes and Model
% version of the BZSL, constrained or unconstrained. If the unconstrained
% model is chosen you can specify the # principal components in the PCA which 
% used as dimensionality reduction technique in unconstrained model. EX: 
%   hyperparameter_tuning(Data split...,'Model', 'unconstrained', 'pca', 500);
% The script returns the desired hyperparameters  required for each model.
% For more details about hyperparameters please refer to the paper.
%
% 4. After getting the parameters, we used the train and test split
% provided within  datasets. We made use of Generalized ZSL setting for the
% split.
%
% 5. Lastly the BZSL model is run. The must inputs for the BZSL is data
% split from step 4, attributes, and the hyperparameters from tuning. Most
% of the hyper-parameters are the same for both models yet there are some
% differences. Please refer to the paper for the full list of
% hyperparameters of each model version. Since random number generation
% involved in the constrained model you could define number of iterations
% in this model to alleviate the randomness on the H score MOreover, there 
% is a tuning option for the BZSL where it is faster in this option if tuning 
% is being performed; ['tuning', true]  Ex: (constrained)
%     Bayesian_ZSL(Data split...,'Model', 'constrained', 'prior_mean', mu_0,...
%     'kappa_0', k_0, 'kappa_1', k_1, 'cov_shape', m, 'invg_shape', a_0, 'invg_scale', b_0, 'iter', 5);
%
% Ex: (unconstrained)
%     Bayesian_ZSL(Data split...,'Model','unconstrained', 'tuning', true, 'prior_mean', mu_0, 
%     'prior_cov', psi, 'kappa_0', k_0, 'kappa_1', k_1, 'cov_shape', m, 'pca', 500);
